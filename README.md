# STOR601-R-cpp-Assessment

Used Rcpp to create an R package that integrates my C++ implementation of the "fundamental algorithm" from the Stable Marriage Problem and its relation to other 
combinatorial problems by Donald E. Knuth, created for Task 1 of the STOR601-R-cpp-Assessment.

This implementation requires a C++ 17 kernel, and was tested on Linux (Ubuntu) system 20.04.2 LTS.
